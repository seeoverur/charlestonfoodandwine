                <p class="lead">Your health and safety remain our highest priority. We maintain rigorous food safety protocols to ensure every dish served meets exceptional hygiene standards.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Vendor Requirements</h2>
                
                <p>All participating vendors must hold current health permits and food handler certifications. Our team conducts thorough inspections of preparation areas, equipment, and serving stations before the festival opens. Each vendor follows strict temperature control guidelines for both hot and cold foods to prevent bacterial growth.</p>

                <p>Food handlers wear protective gloves and maintain proper handwashing procedures throughout service. Cross-contamination prevention protocols ensure that raw and cooked items remain separated, with dedicated cutting boards, utensils, and preparation surfaces for different food types.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Sanitary Food Service</h2>
                
                <p>We require vendors to use single-use serving utensils, plates, and cups whenever possible. All reusable equipment undergoes sanitization using approved cleaning solutions at regular intervals. Food display cases include protective barriers to shield items from environmental contaminants.</p>

                <p>Temperature monitoring occurs continuously, with hot foods maintained above 140°F and cold items kept below 40°F. Any food item sitting outside safe temperature ranges for extended periods is immediately discarded according to health department guidelines.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Allergen Awareness</h3>
                
                <p>Vendors clearly label all dishes containing common allergens including nuts, dairy, gluten, shellfish, and soy. Staff members receive training to answer ingredient questions accurately. We encourage attendees with food allergies to communicate directly with vendors about specific dietary concerns.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Guest Safety Measures</h2>
                
                <p>Handwashing stations are strategically located throughout the festival grounds. Sanitizer dispensers provide convenient access to hand hygiene products. We maintain clean dining areas with frequent trash removal and surface sanitization.</p>

                <p>Our medical response team remains on-site throughout the event to address any health concerns. If you experience any food-related issues, please notify festival staff immediately so we can provide assistance and document the incident.</p>

                <p class="mt-4"><strong>Questions about our safety protocols?</strong> Contact our food safety coordinator for detailed information about specific vendor practices or health accommodations.</p>
